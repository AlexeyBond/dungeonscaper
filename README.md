# Dungeonscaper

This project is an attempt to create a mechanic close to [Townscaper](https://oskarstalberg.com/Townscaper)(but in 2d) and Godot's tilemap editor autotiling, using [my WFC addon for Godot](https://github.com/AlexeyBond/godot-constraint-solving).
It may serve as a proof-of-concept/early prototype for future Godot editor extension, as suggested [here](https://github.com/AlexeyBond/godot-constraint-solving/discussions/26#discussioncomment-10330346).
Most of the code was created in less than 1.5 days, during a game jam, so the code quality is far from the best.
